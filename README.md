## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Through this project, I acquired knowledge and skills in several key areas, encapsulated in following points:

1. HTML: Crafting the project foundation by using the power of HTML and strategically employing `<div>` elements for effective structuring.

2. CSS: Explore fundamental CSS styling techniques such as `text-align`, `color`, `font-weight`, and elevate my layout skills by mastering the powerful **Flexbox** for precise and effortless container centering.

### Continued development

Flexbox played a crucial role in styling this project from start to finish. I plan to continue using it for future projects as I aim to gain a better understanding of its capabilities

### Useful resources
